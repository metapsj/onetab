It is like a database software, currently having basic CRUD operation features. You can use this as a backend for your ReST APIs as well. The software is completely free and opensource. We are coming up with new features and providing more updates. The another beautiful advantage with JSON-base is since it is a NPM module, this fits well in your nodeJs applications eco system. if you want to develop quick prototypes/poc or need of a database with minimal requirements then, JSONBASe is an must option that you can consider. However there is a limitation if you go beyond a million records per table.
